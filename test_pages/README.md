### Test Pages

Within this folder are some of the test pages we used to develop our extraction methodology. These pages were downloaded at random from the NYPL Spacetime repo (https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/city-directories/blob/master/DIRECTORIES.md), primarily from the 1849/1850 directory. 

These pages were used to train out methods, with each new page tested resulting in parameter shifts and changes to the overall structure of the program. It is much to our chagrin that a unversal parameterization was unable to be achieved, resulting in errors from page to page. With small adjustments to the parameters, the code worked for each of these pages at some point.
