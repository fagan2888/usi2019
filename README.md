### Abstract
The New York Public Library holds within its archives dozens of directories containing historical New York City business and residential data. Under a previously commissioned project, several of these tomes – dated between 1849 and 1922 – were digitized, and the textual data had been extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. Our capstone centers on the previously completed research, with three primary goals: exploring opportunities for increasing the accuracy of the data extraction methodology, improving upon the reproducibility of the methods previously used, and exploring the extracted data to demonstrate the potential that these data have for expanding our understanding of 19th century New York City.
